# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for the TikTrue platform to automate building, testing, and deployment processes. The system will provide automated deployment to Liara platform for both backend (Django) and frontend (React) applications, along with comprehensive testing and quality assurance checks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated CI/CD pipeline triggered by GitHub events, so that code changes are automatically tested and deployed without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN the CI/CD pipeline SHALL automatically trigger
2. WHEN pull request is created THEN the pipeline SHALL run tests and quality checks
3. WHEN tests pass on main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy to production
4. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL notify developers and rollback if necessary

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want separate workflows for backend and frontend, so that each component can be built and deployed independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend code changes THEN only backend workflow SHALL execute
2. WHEN frontend code changes THEN only frontend workflow SHALL execute
3. WHEN both change THEN both workflows SHALL execute in parallel
4. WHEN one deployment fails THEN the other SHALL continue independently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing in the pipeline, so that only quality code reaches production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pipeline runs THEN it SHALL execute unit tests for both backend and frontend
2. WHEN tests fail THEN deployment SHALL be blocked
3. WHEN code quality checks fail THEN deployment SHALL be blocked
4. WHEN security scans detect issues THEN deployment SHALL be blocked

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment to Liara, so that successful builds are immediately available in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy to Liara
2. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN the system SHALL verify application health
3. WHEN health checks fail THEN the system SHALL attempt rollback
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL notify relevant stakeholders

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific configurations, so that different environments have appropriate settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to staging THEN staging environment variables SHALL be used
2. WHEN deploying to production THEN production environment variables SHALL be used
3. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN deployment SHALL fail with clear error
4. WHEN secrets are needed THEN they SHALL be securely retrieved from GitHub Secrets

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want build artifacts and caching, so that builds are faster and more efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL cache dependencies to speed up subsequent builds
2. WHEN build completes THEN artifacts SHALL be stored for potential rollback
3. WHEN cache is stale THEN it SHALL be automatically refreshed
4. WHEN artifacts are needed THEN they SHALL be quickly retrievable

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want monitoring and notifications, so that I'm informed about deployment status and issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment starts THEN developers SHALL be notified
2. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN success notification SHALL be sent
3. WHEN deployment fails THEN failure notification with logs SHALL be sent
4. WHEN critical issues occur THEN immediate alerts SHALL be triggered
