```toml
[tool.bandit]
exclude_dirs = ["tests", "migrations", "venv", ".venv"]
skips = ["B101", "B601"]
```

### Safety Configuration
```toml
[tool.safety]
ignore = [
    # Add specific vulnerability IDs to ignore if needed
]
```

### Django Security Settings
- `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True`
- `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000`
- `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True`
- `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True`
